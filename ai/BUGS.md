- [ ] **Cross-browser compatibility issues**

  - Report from u/Malikili-360: "Keeps on reloading for some reason
    Opening it on Private Browser fixed it though (OperaGX)"

- [ ] **Infinite reloading bug**
  - Report from u/Firq_ow: "When I have uBlock Origin enable, the page will constantly refresh and fail to properly load. Disabling uBlock fixes this, but as its one of the most popular extensions, you might want to look into this; Env: Zen 1.12.8b (based on Firefox 138.0.4), uBlock Origin 1.64.0"
  - Report from u/hulleyrob: "Just flashes constantly for me."
